# Libft

### What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at We Think Code_ that requires us to re-create sone of the standard C library functions including some additional functions which we find useful. These functions are used to build our own library that we will be using in future projects.

Clarification: Of course we could just used pre-defined functions in many C libraries, the purpose of We Think Code_ making us do this is so we can aquire a deeper understanding of data structures, string manipulation and basic algorithms. At We Think Code_, we are not permitted to use some of the standard libraries as this is counterintuitive to what they are trying to teach us.
